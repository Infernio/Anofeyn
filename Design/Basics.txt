Anofeyn - Another Necromancy Overhaul for Egocentric Necromancers

Basic Idea: Reanimating needs souls, but is more powerful (based on the power of the soul used)
How to get souls: Soul gems, capturing souls that float around, visiting the soul cairn
About the Soul Cairn: Perk Tree there? Based on activators floating around in the air (Campfire-like)
Also: Optional preparation step (needs some resources and time, can't be done in combat) for much better results
Also: Some new spells
    - cursing debuff -> instant kill on low health, reanimates as powerful skeleton (use https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28957/)
